## Projects: 

[Understanding the purchasing behaviour of customers of a Grocery Store](https://github.com/harshit000794/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Customer_Purchase_Analysis.ipynb)

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the purchase behaviour of different customer segments of a Grocery Store specifically the chips purchasing behaviour
so that the Chips Category Manager can decide which brands are popular among which segments, what are the price preferences of different segments so that they can
devise a strategic plan to reach out to their target customers. The data and the problem was sourced from Quantium as a part of their Forage Virtual Experience.
